# Chatbot based on Encoder Decoder Model with Keras
This repository contains two scripts for train and interacting with a chatbot based on an advanced neural network architecture.
The sequence to sequence model code modified and originally taken from [this keras repository](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/lstm_seq2seq.py).
To get a better understanding of sequence to sequence models with keras we propose this [blog post](https://blog.keras.io/a-ten-minute-introduction-to-sequence-to-sequence-learning-in-keras.html) from Francois Chollet.
# Dataset
The dataset is the Cornell Movie-Quotes Corpus from Christian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lillian Lee and can be
found on this [website](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html).
